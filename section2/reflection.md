## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- Something that resonated with me in the video was having the Growth mindset and the desire to keep learning. I relate with Carmen where she mentions that she didn't do well in school, but kept growing and learning.
- What was new in the video was different ways to tackle progress. Carmen said she pinpoints an area she is struggling and makes a mental note. She then makes a mental list of what she's struggling with. I think that is a great take away for you to grow.
2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- I do not compare myself to anyone else.
- I am always learning something new.
- I don't give up when I'm struggling, and ask questions.
- I'm learning to grow out of procrastination, when I am scared of tackling an assignment or project.
	- I've learned so far that if I just start, I can go from there.
	- I still procrastinate,  but in a shorter time-frame.
3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
- I didn't notice information had been removed. Google is my right hand man all the time; if questions come up.
4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
- A **conditional statement** is a true or false statement.
	- In the Planet Fitness app. There is a Black membership with added amenities.
	- To be a Black member is a conditional statement.
5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
- If you have multiple conditions  you'll need a conditional statement. If / then / else
- If the condition is true execute the statement between the first set { }
- If false execute the 2nd set of { }
6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
- The comments section of GitHub, test any code at anytime
- Or Chrome Dev Tools alt+cmd+i (or j)
7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
- Need practice with logical operators.
