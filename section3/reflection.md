## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
- It was nice being directed to good resources. I had the ability to take notes during the video and from my book.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
- App - Pandora
- use-case - Songs I've "thumbs up"
- This helps the song algorithm for the thumb print listening station. This array holds a string of elements that hold information of favorite songs I have "thumbs up."
3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
- An Array method is a list of string elements that hold information.
4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
- The purpose of the loop is to check for conditions and run code blocks, that can calculate returns faster than humans with greater output.
5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
- A loop helps humans calculate a true or false statement with a code at a fast pace.
- There are 3 parts to a loop
 1. Starting point - Which is called the "initializer"
 2. An End point - Which is called a "condition"
 3. The "incrementer" - This delegates output direction, up or down.
- You can use the combination of a loop with an array. (an array is a list)
6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
- I need more practice with if statement loop and array coding.
